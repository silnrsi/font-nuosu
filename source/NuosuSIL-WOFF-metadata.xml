      Nuosu SIL (originally SIL Yi) was developed in 2000 as a single Unicode
      font for the standardized Yi script used by a large ethnic group in
      southwestern China.
      
      The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
      tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
      1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
      symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
      to form a syllabary.
      
      The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
      was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
      there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
      The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
      Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
      incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.
      
      One font is included in this release:
      
      * Nuosu SIL Regular
      
      SIL International is the creator of the Nuosu SIL fonts.
