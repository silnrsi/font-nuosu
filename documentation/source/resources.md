## Requirements

These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.

## Installation

Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on [Font installation](https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation).

## Keyboarding and character set support

The [SIL Yi keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_yi) is also available for the Yi Syllables (U+A000..U+A48F); however, it does not provide keystrokes for the Yi Radicals (U+A490..U+A4CF).

For information on other keyboarding options see the overview at [Keyboard Systems Overview (ScriptSource)](https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw).

See [Character set support](charset.md) for details of the Unicode characters supported by these fonts.

## Rendering and application support

No issues.

## Web fonts

Web font versions of these fonts (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are available in the `web` folder. These can be copied to a web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS demo page is also included. For more information on the options and techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see [Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages](http://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts).

## Text conversion

These fonts are encoded according to [The Unicode Standard](http://unicode.org). If you have text that uses a legacy, non-Unicode encoding there are tools that can help you convert that text for use with Unicode fonts. See [Introduction to Text Conversion and Transliteration](https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt).
