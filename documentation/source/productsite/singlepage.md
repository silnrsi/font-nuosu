<h2 id="about">About</h2>

Nuosu SIL is a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a large ethnic group in southwestern China. The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the 1970â€™s by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen to form a syllabary.

The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa. The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right. Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.

Nuosu SIL includes a complete set of Yi syllables and radicals as defined in the [Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/), plus a basic set of Latin characters and punctuation. Yi radicals which were added to Unicode 3.2 (U+A4A2..U+A4A3, U+A4B4, U+A4C1, U+A4C5) are also included in the font. Representative samples:

### Data Conversion

Compiled and uncompiled TECkit [conversion tables](https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/langs/i/ii-Yiii/mappings) can be downloaded. **YiIPA** maps data using the Yi syllables for input and outputs IPA. **YiPinyin** maps data using Yi syllables for input and outputs romanized syllables (lower case) with spaces between. These maps can be used with [TECkit](https://software.sil.org/teckit/){.external} and/or [SILConverters](https://software.sil.org/silconverters/).

### Keyboarding

The [SIL Yi keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_yi) is also available for the Yi Syllables (U+A000..U+A48F); however, it does not provide keystrokes for the Yi Radicals (U+A490..U+A4CF)."
