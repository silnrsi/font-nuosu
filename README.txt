TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has, however,
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to fonts@sil.org.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding:
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. It uses the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You will need to install the
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use.

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard,
the Keyman program can be helpful. A Keyman keyboard is available at:

https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_yi

This keyboard package, however, comes with an outdated font and does not
supprot for full range of characters supprted by Nuosu SIL.
